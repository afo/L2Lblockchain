# L2L Github Setup Instructions
_____
**These instructions will guide you through the process of creating a private Github repository so that you can host your project, submit code homeworks, and collaborate with your classmates on your project.** 

1. Create a (free) Github account associated with your student `@berkeley.edu email` (if you have one already you can associate the account with your Berkeley email). You will need to have a verified `*.edu` email address for step 2. Choose a logical username, e.g.
  `alexanderfredojala`: [https://education.github.com/](https://education.github.com/)

2. When you have registered then request an educational discount. This is highly recommended. Request a discount here: [https://education.github.com/](https://education.github.com/pack). You are a
  `Student` and you want an `Individual account`.

#### When you have a Github account that can create private repos, you need to complete the steps below:

1. Create a repository on GitHub.

2. Add Alex (Github name: `afo` ) and Hamdi (GitHub name: `hamdiallam` ) as collaborators so we have access to your repo (even if it's private). To do this look at the upper right-hand corner of your repository's main page, you should see a button labelled "Settings". Click on "Settings". Choose the "Collaborators" button on the left-hand side of the "Settings" page.

3. In order to work locally with files in your repository you need to clone the repo to a directory on your computer (e.g., I use ~/src). You can do this in the terminal by running:

    `git clone https://github.com/[GIT USERNAME]/[REPO NAME]`


#### PS. If you're not familiar with git and version control, please read a guide on it. As this will be a useful tool for you in your project.
